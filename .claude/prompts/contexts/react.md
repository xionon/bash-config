Context: React Development

Follow React best practices:
- Functional components with hooks
- Proper state management (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Component composition over inheritance
- Props validation with PropTypes or TypeScript
- Meaningful component and variable names
- Separate concerns (logic, styling, markup)

Use modern React patterns and avoid deprecated features.
