Context: JavaScript/Node.js Development

Follow modern JavaScript practices:
- ES6+ syntax and features
- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase)
- JSDoc comments for functions
- Async/await over Promise chains
- Proper error handling
- ESLint-compatible code style

Prefer standard library and well-established packages.
